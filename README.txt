added the ability to change game 'on the fly' throught the command
input of '+' while the game is running, this allows you to currently change
line of sight being toggled on or off, fog on or off, invincibility on or
off, and currently working on changing the number of monsters.
I am getting a hung terminal currently. I will look to fix this after work
however this is currently a bug in this initial submission.

I also added ASCII art animations, and a banner detailing initial run
conditions for the game. These conditions will show different toggles
based upon command switches input to the terminal.
